/* The LC86K's two synchronous serial channels, SIO0 and SIO1 -- the cable a
   VMU uses to talk to another VMU.
 *
 * Modelled a byte at a time rather than a bit at a time: on hardware a channel
 * is bit-banged over Port 1 (SO0/SI0/SCK0 on P1.0-2, SO1/SI1/SCK1 on P1.3-5)
 * and a transfer is eight clock edges at the rate SBR sets, where here the
 * whole byte moves at the tick the eighth edge would have landed. Three limits
 * follow from that:
 *
 *  - Software that watches the pins mid-byte, or clocks by hand instead of
 *    letting the serial block do it, will not be fooled.
 *  - SCON is sampled once a cycle rather than hooked on write, so a guest that
 *    cleared and re-set CTRL without a cycle in between would have its restart
 *    missed. Real code cannot: instructions take cycles.
 *  - A transfer is atomic on the wire but not in time here: the sender holds
 *    its completion open briefly after the eighth edge for the peer's half to
 *    cross the transport. On hardware both halves land on the same edge.
