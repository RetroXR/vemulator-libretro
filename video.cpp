/* The four segments along the bottom of a VMU screen: file, game, clock and
   the flash-write warning. They are etched into the glass rather than drawn
   on a grid, so each is a single shape that is either lit or not, and they
   are drawn here at the size they are shown -- one bit a pixel, 12 wide and
   ICON_ROWS tall, most significant bit leftmost.
 *
 * Shrinking a detailed drawing of one down to this size does not work: the
 * artwork the original carried is 24x32 with one pixel lines, and halving it
 * turns those into mush. The four also sat at different places in that grid,
 * so a single crop caught the middle of the write icon and rendered it as a
 * solid block. */
